Frame Scheme:
    Slightly expanded upon from prior work, with extra fields added in addition to request to make control smoother.
    Format: [SourceNetwork][SourceNode][DestNetwork][DestNode][SequenceNumber][CRC][Size][Ack/Data]

    Network and node ID are treated separately for smoother parsing, and as a side note technically allows more of each
    Each node adds a sequence number to its frames so that data can be tracked.
        This prevents issues arising from potential duplicate frames, as well as explicit acks for each received frame.
    As requested, only one of ack or data will be present in the actual data.  In the object itself, the proper field
      will be present, and the other field will be filled with dummy data for the container. This only gives the illusion
      that both ack and data are present in each frame, they are actually not.


Acknowledgement Scheme:
    Stored and treated internally as an integer, but like all frame data is sent as byte. Codes are as follows:
    1 (1)  : Firewall messages finished, continue standard initialization
    2 (10) : CRC error -- resend frame
    3 (11) : Message received
    4 (100): NACK -- Message firewalled, do not retransmit.
    5 (101): Source object has no more messages to send
    6 (110): Network is finished; terminate



The code can be run via the make file (instructions pending)

A brief outline of my code structure:
    Frame.java: Outlines frame structure and various supported methods, including translating to and from byte arrays,
                  and reading in frames from an inputStream.

    FrameLostException.java:
                Throwable exception in case a Frame.java static method detects data loss.

    Main.java:  Main class. Based on command line argument, generates n data files, 1 switch server, and n nodes.
                Waits on each runnable object to finish before finishing itself.
                Note: main does *not* do cleanup; each object performs necessary cleanup on itself and owned threads
                Note: You can enable debugInfo flags in main to see status updates from each thread.
                      By default, debugIngo is disabled; you will see no updates unless you do this.

    Node.java:  Object definition for Node. Parses messages from data file and generates output file on instantiation.
                1) Sends and receives messages from paired NodeThread (Switch), writing incoming messages to output file.
                2) Ignores messages with destination IDs that do not match Node ID.
                3) Informs NodeThread when finished sending data.
                4) Runs cleanup and terminates upon signal from NodeThread (Switch).

    NodeThread.java:
                Object definition for NodeThread.  Acts as intermediary communication thread between Switch and a Node.
                1) Establishes secondary serverSocket on local convenient port, negotiates new connection with paired Node
                2) Receives data from paired Node and passes along to Switch for handling
                3) Receives data from Switch and sends to paired node
                4) Notifies Switch when unidentified client sends first message: switch will add client to switch table,
                     and NodeThread will mark paired client as identified.
                5) Notifies Switch when paired Node is finished sending data (determined via control message), then marks
                     self as finished sending data.
                6) When instructed to finish by Switch, notifies Node to finish, then performs cleanup on self.

    Switch.java:
                Object definition for Switch.  Contains 2 threads, as before:
                1) Accept new clients on main server port, spawn NodeThread to handle communication.
                2) Manages incoming messages and passes to NodeThread based on logical port from switch table, or if
                     destination is unidentified, floods message to all NodeThreads.
                   Waits for all NodeThreads to finish sending data, then performs cleanup (forcefully exits other threads,
                     instructs all NodeThreads to finish)
